Background/purpose:
    - spin it off as photomanipulation!
    - Visuals + audio = universal language.
    - That said, we simply think it's something cool to explore!
    - Learning cool stuff
            - How to parse mp3
            - Sampling sound and image!
            - aliasing in image if we alias in sound?

Resources:
Linux, Personal computer-level hardware
MP3 Analyzier:Spectro! http://spectro.enpts.com/
    C++.
    HW1 codebase
    Various MP3 and SVG files
    MATLAB?

Deliverables:
- svg in, svg out
- demo:  select song, show resulting image transform
- measure quality:  "unit test" with individual sound properites 
    - single frequency (tone)
    - single volume
- answers?  explore the interrelation between visual and audio compositions

- compare effects of various song frequencies on a single image
- observe aliasing effects in audio input vs image
