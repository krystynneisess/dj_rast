            <p><b>Title:</b>  DJ Rast</p>

            <p><b>Summary:</b>  DJ Rast is a photo-manipulation program which reacts to audio input.  Specifically, we will be mapping qualities such as frequency and amplitude patterns from MP3 files to various rasterization and SVG transformations.  Through DJ Rast, we hope to explore and visualize the interrelationship between said audio and visual features. We also have goals to apply a filter that simulates if the image were painted in a certain medium like oil or acrylic paint.</p>

        <h2 align="middle">Background</h2>
 
            <p><i>As a slow melody rolls in, the colors seem to blur.  Yet gradually, the tune quickens.  Becomes louder.  Bolder.  As if to equally enjoy the change, the image before you brightens, hues growing more intense by the beat.   Observing its steady transformation, you begin to see the song in, quite literally, a new light...</i></p>

            <p>What you've envisioned is DJ Rast, a photo-manipulation program which responds to audio input, as opposed to more traditional, explicit user input (eg. manually selecting individual filters).  With an appreciation for both sight and sound as universal mediums of communication, we hope to explore the relationships that manifest when mapping auditory qualities--namely, frequency (pitch) and amplitude (volume)--with various image filters and transformations.<p>

            <p>That is to say, we are interested in what kind of patterns will emerge from different patterns in sound as well as whether we can get an image to respond to different sampling techniques of the sound.  For example, if there is aliasing in the sampling of the sound, will there be aliasing in the image?</p> 

            <p>The challenges we face are parsing image files, extracting meaningful information that corresponds to information we can modify in an image, as well as thinking about how to essentially "paint" an image out of different materials.  This involves thinking about how materials like oil pant behave and how that can be modeled as a filter over an image. We think this would be a really fun and visually interesting project that adds an additional element to computer graphics that we haven't explored yet:  realtime filtering based on a signal.  We think if we are successful this project would be quite interesting to look at while listening to a favorite song/ looking at a favorite image.</p>

            <p>In our project, we intend to explore in depth the following CS184 course curriculum topics:</p>

            <ul> 
                <li>Sampling</li>
                <li>Filtering</li>
                <li>Transformations</li>
                <li>Colors</li>
                <li>Image Processing: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Blurring</li>
                        <li>Sharpening</li>
                        <li>Edge Detection</li>
                        <li>Etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Possibly Lighting</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We will also draw on the ideas of <a href = 'https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/download/cstr.04.pdf'>rendering artistic materials</a> as found by the Knowledge Discovery Lab of North Carolina State University.</p>

        <h2 align="middle">Resources</h2>

            <p>Below are the hardware and software resources we are potentially considering using to complete this project:<p>
            <ul> 
                <li>OpenCV</li>
                <li>Matlab</li>
                <li>Assignment 1 codebase</li>
                <li>MP3 and SVG files</li>
                <li><a href='http://spectro.enpts.com/'>Spectro</a>, a free MP3 analyzier</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>

            <h3>Baseline</h3>
                <p>At a minimum, we should be able to sample a single frequency tone (ie. a single note) from an audio file, and from that be able to modify the image somehow based on the properties of the sound (i.e. frequency, ampltitude).  Our current ideas are to assign colors to the frequency. We should also be able to transform an image to look like at least one different medium like oil paint. The image should respond (in a perhaps selectable way) to changes in the sound both in terms of frequency and volume.  We should also observe the effects of aliasing this tone on our output image.</p>
            <p>

            <h3>Aspirations!</h3>
            <p>The "reach goals" for this project are to implement multiple image filters along with potentially changing filters (i.e. from acrylic to oil) depending on some heuristic of our audio sample, such as volume. Getting the image to update in realtime over an entire song, or multiple songs is also a cool goal to reach!</p>

            <h3>Deliverables</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Demo:  Select a song, and show the resulting image transform.</li>

                <li>Measure quality:  "Unit test" with individual sound properites. </li>

                <li>Investigations of more complex trends:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Between several constant color images, how our intepretations of sound frequency will affect different colors.</li>
                        <li>Between a single constnt color image, how different frquencies affect the same color.</li>
                        <li>Between several songs, how different songs affect a single image.</li>
                        <li>Between a single song, how different images are affected.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li>[Task 2]</li>
                    Preliminary proof of concept--image transform with a single tone.  Generate a sinple mp3 file, possibly having a base feature to test this mp3 file against an image file.
