            <p><b>Title:</b>  DJ Rast</p>

            <p><b>Summary:</b>  DJ Rast is a photo-manipulation program which reacts to audio input.  Specifically, we will be mapping qualities such as frequency and amplitude patterns from MP3 files to various rasterization and SVG transformations.  Through DJ Rast, we hope to explore and visualize the interrelationship between said audio and visual features.</p>

        <h2 align="middle">Background</h2>
 
            <p><i>As a slow melody rolls in, the colors seem to blur.  Yet gradually, the tune quickens.  Becomes louder.  Bolder.  As if to equally enjoy the change, the image before you brightens, hues growing more intense by the beat.   Observing its steady transformation, you begin to see the song in, quite literally, a new light...</i></p>

            <p>What you've envisioned is DJ Rast, a photo-manipulation program which responds to audio input, as opposed to more traditional, explicit user input (eg. manually selecting individual filters).  With an appreciation for both sight and sound as universal mediums of communication, we hope to explore the relationships that manifest when mapping auditory qualities--namely, frequency (pitch) and amplitude (volume)--with various image filters and transformations.<p>

            <p>Our idea is essentially a kind of photomanipulation. We are interested in what kind of patterns will emerge from different patterns in sound as well as whether we can get an image to respond to different sampling techniques of the sound. For example, if there is aliasing in the sampling of the sound, will there be aliasing in the image? The challenges we face are parsing image files, extracting meaningful information out of it that somehow corresponds to information we can extract or modify in an image, as well as thinking about how to essentially "paint" an image out of different materials. This involves thinking about how materials like oil pant behave and how that can be modeled as a filter over an image. We think this would be a really fun and visually interesting project that adds an additional element to computer graphics that we haven't explored yet, realtime filtering based on a signal. We think if we are successful this project would be very interesting to look at while listening to a favorite song/ looking at a favorite image.</p>
            <p>The following are topics from the CS184 course material that we will be exploring in depth to make this project work: </p>
            <ul> 
            <li>Sampling</li>
            <li>Filtering</li>
            <li>Transformations</li>
            <li>Colors</li>
            <li>Image Processing: 
                <ul>
                <li>Blurring</li>
                <li>Sharpening</li>
                <li>Edge Detection</li>
                <li>Etc.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Possibly Lighting</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We will also draw on ideas of rendering artisitc materials in this <a href = 'https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/download/cstr.04.pdf'>paper</a> by the Knowledge Discovery Lab of North Carolina State University.</p>

        <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>

            <h3>Baseline</h3>
                <p>At the least we should be able to sample a single frequency tone from an audiofile (i.e. a single note) and from that be able to modify the image somehow based on the properties of the sound (i.e. frequency, ampltitude). Our current ideas are to assign colors to the frequency. We should also be able to transform an image to look like at least one different medium like oil paint. The image should respond (in perhaps a selectable way) to changes in the sound both in terms of frequency and volume. We should also observe the effects of aliasing this tone on our output image.</p>
            <p>

            <h3>Aspirations!</h3>
            <p>The reach goals for this project are to implement multiple image filters along with potentially changing filters (i.e. from acrylic to oil) depending on some heuristic of our audio sample like the volume. Getting the image to update in realtime over an entire song, or multiple songs is also a cool goal to reach.</p>

            <h3>Deliverables:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>demo:  select song, show resulting image transform</li>

                <li>measure quality:  "unit test" with individual sound properites </li>

                <li>Investigate images of one constant color and see how our intepretation of sound frequency will affect each color differently</li>

                <li>Investigate one image of a constant color and see how different frquencies affect the same color differently</li>

                <li>Compare different songs on a single image and see how that song affect the images differently.</li>

                <li>Compare different images on a single song and see how they are affected by that song.</li>
            </ul>
